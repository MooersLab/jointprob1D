# jointprob, section D

## meeting1.Rmd

Rmarkdown file that I presented in the first meeting of section D of the [jointprob community](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/) on Saturday, August 20, 2022. 
The jointprob community is a Bayesian data analysis study group.
The goal is to work our way through Richard McELreath's *Rethinking Statistics, 2nd Ed* and the Grolemund and Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](https://bookdown.org/roy_schumacher/r4ds/). 
It is sponsored by the [SciClo project](https://scicloj.github.io).
