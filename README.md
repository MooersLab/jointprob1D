# jointprob, section D

The [jointprob community](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/) is a Bayesian data analysis study group.
The goal is to work through Richard McELreath's *Rethinking Statistics, 2nd Ed*.
the [SciClo project](https://scicloj.github.io) sponsors jointprob. 
Daniel Slutsky leads the meetings.

## meeting1.Rmd

Rmarkdown file that I presented in the first meeting of section D of the on Saturday, August 20, 2022. 
I covered chapter 1 of McElreath and chapter 1-4 of Grolemund and Wickham [*R for Data Science*](https://bookdown.org/roy_schumacher/r4ds/).

## meeting2b.Rmd

I edited this Rmarkdown file that I presented in the second meeting of section D of the on Saturday, September 3, 2022. 
Daniel Slutsky gave an excellent 80-minute presentation about computing the posterior distribution, which set me up well to present how to use grid approximation to estimate the posterior distribution in R.

I included the suggested exercises from Chapter 2 of McElreath's *Rethinking Statistics, 2nd Ed*. 
Next, I ventured off and tried a triangular distribution from the `extraDistr` package as a prior.

I added some embellishments like the normalization of the prior and the summing of the prior and the likelihood as sanity checks.
These embellishments were not required to compute the correct posterior, but they deepened the understanding of what was happening.

## meeting3b.Rmd

I presented this Rmarkdown file in the third meeting of section D on Saturday, September 17, 2202.
It recaps the grid approximation presentation and then covers the two other *motors* of the Bayesian data analysis engine: quadratic approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.


## meetingX.ipynb

I presented this Jupyter notebook on infomration theory at the Christmas Eve meeting of jointprob.
